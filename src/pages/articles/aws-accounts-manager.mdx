# Simplify Your AWS Account Management with AWS Accounts Manager

As developers, managing multiple AWS accounts can be a daunting task. Each account comes with its own set of credentials and configurations, making it challenging to keep track of them all. That's why I developed AWS Accounts Manager, a browser extension designed to streamline the management of multiple AWS accounts.

## Introducing AWS Accounts Manager

AWS Accounts Manager is a browser extension that acts as a password manager specifically for AWS accounts. It helps you manage multiple AWS accounts effortlessly, saving you time and reducing the risk of errors. With AWS Accounts Manager, you can:

- **Custom Aliases**: Easily identify and manage accounts using personalized aliases.
- **Auto-Submit**: Minimize clicks with automatic form submission, making login seamless.
- **Secure Sync**: Export and import CSV files to securely share account information across browsers and devices.

## Why I Built AWS Accounts Manager

As a developer deeply involved in AWS-related work, I understand the challenges of managing multiple AWS accounts. Existing password managers felt inadequate, especially when dealing with multiple organizations and IAM enthusiasts. I wanted a solution that would simplify this complexity and make managing AWS accounts more efficient.

## Under the Hood

AWS Accounts Manager is built using the Plasmo framework, which combines the efficiency of React. The design is clean and intuitive, utilizing Tailwind UI to enhance user experience.

## Get Involved

AWS Accounts Manager is an open-source project, and I welcome contributions and feedback. Visit the GitHub repository to contribute code or suggest features. Your feedback is invaluable to me, as I'm always looking for ways to improve the extension.

## Try It Out

Several users, including myself and my friends, have found AWS Accounts Manager incredibly useful. I encourage you to try it out and see how it can simplify your AWS account management. You can find AWS Accounts Manager on the Chrome, Edge, and Firefox stores.
