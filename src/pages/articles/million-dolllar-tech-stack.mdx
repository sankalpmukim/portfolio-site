## Introduction

Choosing the right tech stack for your project is crucial for its success. In 2023, a tech stack that prioritizes type safety and leverages TypeScript for both frontend and backend development can provide numerous benefits. This article will focus on the best tech stack for 2023, incorporating TypeScript for frontend and backend, and utilizing React technologies on the frontend. Additionally, we will explore the "Bleed responsibly" mentality, which emphasizes using bleeding-edge technology after it has been battle-tested and proven reliable for production at scale.

So in this article, I will write about the Ideal tech stack for startups in 2023. This article is useful for people looking planning tech for their startups, new developers looking for technologies to learn, and people who are interested in the future of technology.

My focus in deciding these technologies is on the following points:

- Fast MVP developemnt.
- The technologies should be reliable and stable.
- It should be fairly modern(not ancient) but not bleeding edge(not battle tested).
- Developer friendly.
- Requires less code to accomplish more. (Less code is better)

I plan to evaluate multiple options for each preference and then choose the best one. I will also try to explain why I chose that particular technology.

## The Tech Stack: TypeScript and React

1. TypeScript: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that provides excellent type safety. It has gained significant adoption in the professional world and is widely used in the React community. TypeScript helps detect problems with code while writing it, reducing the chances of introducing bugs. It offers advanced type checking and tooling support, making it an ideal choice for ensuring type safety in both frontend and backend development.

2. React: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It follows a component-based architecture, making it easy to build reusable UI components. React offers a virtual DOM, which enhances performance by efficiently updating only the necessary parts of the UI. It has a large and active community, providing extensive support, libraries, and tools. React is widely adopted in the industry and offers excellent performance, scalability, and maintainability.

## Bleed Responsibly mentality

The "Bleed responsibly" mentality refers to using bleeding-edge technologies but only after they have been battle-tested and proven reliable for production at scale. While it is tempting to adopt the latest technologies, it is essential to consider their stability, maturity, and community support. By adopting a "Bleed responsibly" approach, you can benefit from the advantages of cutting-edge technologies while minimizing the risks associated with early adoption.

## Best Tech Stack for 2023

Based on the research, the best tech stack for 2023, focusing on type safety and React technologies, includes:

1. MERN Stack: The MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) is a popular choice for full-stack JavaScript development. It combines MongoDB as the database, Express.js as the backend framework, React for the frontend, and Node.js as the runtime environment. Integrating TypeScript into the MERN stack ensures type safety throughout the development process.

2. TypeScript + Next.js: Next.js is a popular React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and other advanced features. Combining TypeScript with Next.js allows for type-safe development and enhanced productivity. Next.js provides excellent performance and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale production applications.

3. TypeScript + Nest.js: Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework that leverages TypeScript to build efficient and scalable server-side applications. It follows the architectural principles of Angular, making it familiar to Angular developers. Nest.js offers strong typing and dependency injection, ensuring type safety and maintainability in backend development.

## Type Safe ORMs for Backend Development: Prisma and Drizzle ORM

### Drizzle ORM

Drizzle ORM is an emerging TypeScript ORM tool that offers several advantages over Prisma [blog.logrocket.com](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-drizzle-type-safe-orm/). While Prisma is known for its type safety and easy-to-use API, Drizzle offers a more flexible and extensible solution, especially when handling complex queries with multiple JOINs. The main philosophy behind Drizzle is that if you know SQL, you know Drizzle.

Drizzle is designed with maximum type safety in mind and is meant to be a library, not a framework. It stays as an opt-in solution all the time at any levels [finddev.tools](https://finddev.tools/compare/drizzle-orm/vs/prisma). At the time of writing, Drizzle is still very new, so there is much to be desired. However, it is already usable in a production environment for several relational databases. If you're familiar with any notable databases like MySQL or Postgres, you can use Drizzle confidently [blog.logrocket.com](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-drizzle-type-safe-orm/).

### Prisma

Prisma is an open-source, next-generation ORM that is auto-generated and type-safe, making it a powerful tool for both TypeScript and Node.js applications blog.logrocket.com. It allows developers to easily manage and interact with their database. Prisma has a significant community of open-source contributors and maintainers, which ensures continuous improvement and support.

Prisma's unique design enables it to provide an unparalleled level of type safety among TypeScript ORMs. It generates a local CRUD client that encodes your data model, thus offering accurate typings for nested relation queries and partial queries that modify the shape of returned models prisma.io.

Moreover, Prisma works fundamentally differently compared to traditional ORMs. With Prisma, you define your models in the declarative Prisma schema, which serves as the single source of truth for your database schema and the models in your programming language. In your application code, you can then use Prisma Client to read and write data in your database in a type-safe manner without the overhead of managing complex model instances prisma.io.

Both Prisma and Drizzle ORM are strong choices for backend development with TypeScript due to their focus on type safety. Prisma's unique design and strong community support make it a reliable choice. At the same time, Drizzle's flexibility and extensibility make it a strong contender, especially for developers familiar with SQL. It's important to evaluate the specific needs of your project when choosing between these ORMs.

## Advantages of React Native for Startups to Build a Quick MVP for Mobile Devices at Low Cost

In the fast-paced startup world, building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a crucial step to validate ideas, attract investors, and gather user feedback. Startups often face challenges such as limited resources, tight timelines, and the need to target multiple platforms. This is where React Native, a cross-platform framework, comes to the rescue. In this article, we will explore the advantages of using React Native to build a quick MVP for mobile devices at a low cost.

### Cost-Effectiveness

One of the key advantages of React Native is its ability to significantly reduce development costs. With React Native, startups can leverage a single codebase to build mobile applications that work seamlessly on both iOS and Android platforms.

Startups can gather user feedback early in the development process and make necessary adjustments, leading to a more refined and user-centric product.

### Native-Like Performance

While React Native is a cross-platform framework, it doesn't sacrifice native-like performance. React Native uses native components, ensuring that the app looks and feels like a native application on each platform. It leverages the device's GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to render components, resulting in smooth and responsive user interfaces. This performance advantage is crucial for startups as it enhances the user experience and increases the chances of user adoption.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

Targeting multiple platforms can be time-consuming and costly for startups. React Native offers a solution by enabling developers to write a single codebase that can be used to develop apps for both iOS and Android platforms.
