            My beginning.
          </h2>
          <p>
            I've loved making things for as long as I can remember, and
            wrote my first program when I was around 12 years old. Worked on
            QBasic in my school's computer lab. The joy of compiling
            and running a program I wrote myself was unlike anything I'd
            ever experienced.
          </p>
          <p>
            At 15, I was working on robotics projects after school hours, I
            represented my school in international robotics competitions in
            Singapore. Writing programs using drag and drop editors that
            compiled to C and ran perfectly on microcontrollers gave me
            boundless joy.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-100 sm:text-3xl">My inspiration.</h2>
          <p>
            Some time ago, when I published a React Native app to the Play
            Store, I got a huge rush, so much happiness when it finally went
            live. I got to introspect over my journey and realise my true
            motivation into becoming a software engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app was a very simple program that stored user's WiFi
            credentials locally and helped them login to Campus WiFi with
            one tap. About 2 years before that, I had published my first
            website to Heroku. The most important point was that something I
            made was able to be used by the outside world.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a simple app that converted students' timetables to
            Google Calendars. I made this project because I wanted to use
            Google Calendar for my timetable and thought this process
            doesn't need to be manual! I was so excited when I saw the
            logs on Heroku of other people using the project. Every single
            count of person who used it made a huge difference to my life.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-100 sm:text-3xl">My journey.</h2>
          <p>
            I'm currently a 3rd year student at Vellore Institute of
            Technology, Vellore, Tamil Nadu. I started to seriously code
            only in my 1st year of college.
          </p>
          <p>
            As college taught us the basics of programming in Python, I
            worked in python scripts majority of the time. As Django was the
            popular major choice for full stack web development, and I
            wanted to build complete projects, I started learning Django. I
            made several projects in Django, and I was able to get a decent
            grasp of the framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            While working on a particular Django full stack project, I was
            having to learn and write a lot of DOM logic in javascript for
            interactivity. I found and did several things that Javascript
            was great for! As I polished my javascript skills, I started
            learning React.
          </p>
          <p>
            After doing their official tutorial, I made one of my favorite
            projects till date, A{' '}
            <a href="https://numpuz.sankalpmukim.dev" class="text-zinc-800 hover:text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-300 dark:hover:text-zinc-200">
              Number Puzzle Game
            </a>{' '}
            in React. I made the first version in about a week, then over
            time, kept adding features to it. I was able to learn a lot
            about React, and I was able to make a project that I was proud
            of. Over time, I added responsiveness, dark mode, made it
            installable using PWAs, and added a leaderboard using Firebase.
            I learnt how to write advanced performant React by improving
            this project, understanding and reducing redundant re renders.
          </p>
          <p>
            For some time, I kept doing Frontend, learnt using NextJS, and
            made a few projects. I was able to learn a lot about React and
            NextJS, but I was missing out on the backend. I wanted to learn
            how to make a full stack project, and I wanted to learn how to
            make a backend that was scalable, secure and reliable. So I
            slowly shifted into Typescript and backend.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of today, Typescript is my primary go to language but I am
            also learning Go in my free time. Since the beginning I have
            enjoyed being full stack to be able to make complete projects by
            myself. So now, I can make a web or an app frontend. Make a
            backend with both SQL or a NoSQL database. I can deploy the
            project on a cloud platform and make it scale with confidence.
            And I am looking for opportunities that will allow me to
            continue to learn and grow.
